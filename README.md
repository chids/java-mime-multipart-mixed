Simple MIME mixed/multipart parsing utility based on javax.mail.

There's some rudimentary [examples](http://github.com/chids/java-mime-multipart-mixed/tree/master/src/test/java/se/pp/gustafson/marten/mime/examples)

While exploring the link walking facilities in [Riak](http://riak.basho.com/) I was forced to handle MIME multipart in Java which proved to be a bit of a struggle. So in order to learn the MIME classes in javax.mail I wrote this utility lib.
